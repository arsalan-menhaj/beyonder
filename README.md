# Beyonder

A free little web-app to make it easier to create homebrew monsters through DnDBeyond. 

All you need to do is input any text that follows the standard syntax of a 5E statblock (there is an example within the page itself), and Beyonder will auto-generate the markup that DnDBeyond needs to recognize the text as a dice roll, spell, or condition. 


Created using Svelte, and published via Netlify to https://beyonder.netlify.app/.
